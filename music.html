            &nbsp;&nbsp; Music has had such a large influence on my life. When I was just in grade one, I was introduced to the piano, which I quickly despised.
            Yes, I didnâ€™t enjoy the piano when I was younger. But as I grew up, I realized more; I realized that although I wasnâ€™t talented at piano,
            I could work as hard as I could towards it. So when I was in grade 5, I did the RCM level 4 test, and received a grade of 90.
            I was very proud of that grade, and still am, itâ€™s like a reminder that I did that, that I can do things like that.
            Even though recently, I did the level 8 exam, and received a grade of 81, that won't discourage me from pursuing
            what I want to do in the future, because I know if I work hard enough it's possible to get there. <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; But why did the music have such a large influence? Well, it taught me that everything wonâ€™t come easy.
            As I mentioned before, I wasnâ€™t really talented when it came to music; I couldnâ€™t memorize everything, nor could I know everything.
            But that made me want to learn what I couldnâ€™t already know. As well, it really taught me to open my eyes and see the world differently.
            Really. My knowledge of music really helped me be more open-minded; when a song comes on the radio,
            I notice things that I once never could, and itâ€™s a great feeling. Music will forever resonate within me.
