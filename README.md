# Personal-Website-V1

A website about myself created using HTML and CSS. Although this was created a few years ago, I've been working hard on my front-end skills, especially with regards to Javascript.

As I code more, and gain more experience in the field, I look forwards to adding more of my front-end projects onto my Github repositories. Look out!
