            &emsp;Who am I? I like to ask that question because to be honest, I don’t have a direct answer to that.
            My name is Dawson, but what else? Well, I'll try to tell you anyways. <br><br>
            &emsp;Born in Toronto, I live a pretty standard life. Wake up, eat, go to school, eat, go to school, do homework, sleep, repeat.
            But I believe that that’s what makes me special and unique. The fact that I’m normal means I’m special.
            Maybe a normal person wouldn't enjoy sports and music as much as I do. Maybe a normal person doesn't do the extracurriculars I do.
            Just maybe, a normal person doesn't have the achievements that I do. But all of this is what defines me as a person; this is who I am. <br><br>
            &emsp;Anyways, I hope you enjoy my website, go ahead and visit my other pages to find out more about me!
            Also, here are some things about me! <br><br>
