        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I‚Äôve never always loved sports. When I was much younger, my mother signed me up for a plethora of sports, from figure skating to basketball.
            But I didn't enjoy a lot of the stuff that she was throwing at me. <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I did figure skating from when I was in grade 1 to grade 3. I didn't enjoy it.
            I did basketball for some short &nbsp; amounts of time, never consistently. I did soccer for a tiny bit.
            I just couldn't find something that I really enjoyed, and could keep up. <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; That is, until I was introduced to baseball. In the fourth grade, my mom signed me up for a house league baseball league, and I really really enjoyed it.
            Could this be it, a sport that I really enjoyed? Well, it turns out, it &nbsp; was. I had baseball on my mind everyday, and it was really fun.
            This helped open my eyes to look for new opportunities, in grade 7, I was re-introduced to basketball, which is now my favourite sport.
            I was also given the chance to do 800m running, and I really enjoyed that. I wrote this to show the massive impact that sports had on me
            and my life. Sports is life!
