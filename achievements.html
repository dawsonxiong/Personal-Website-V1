        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; First, I‚Äôd like to talk about one of, if not, the most important achievement that I‚Äôve ever gotten-getting into the IB programme here at Victoria Park.
            I know that the process of getting in isn‚Äôt the hardest. But what I do know is that I‚Äôve been put in this position for a reason,
            and I know that I‚Äôm now capable of handling whatever is put in front of me. This achievement gives me inspiration and hope that‚Äôll resonate with me forever.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The second most important achievement that I have received is my RCM level 8 exam results. Again, I feel like it‚Äôs not 100% the impressiveness of the achievement,
            81% isn't very good; rather it's the experience and knowledge gained while working towards the achievement. Piano was a hard thing-I can‚Äôt lie there.
            But I also learned a lot when playing, and if you‚Äôd like to take a look at piano‚Äôs role in my life,
            click the music link on the navigation bar, or <a href = "music.html">here.</a><br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I‚Äôd like to speak about the HSK test, which is a Chinese reading proficiency test. About 3 years ago,
            I had the opportunity to do the level IV test, and after hours of studying, I finished with a result of 91,
            which I was very proud of. Fast forward a bit, and I attempted to do HSK V, which was a significant jump from HSK IV.
            I tried, but after countless sessions of studying and preparing, I ended up not doing so well.
            But I take this as motivation to keep moving with my Chinese knowledge and one day be able to match my HSK IV mark.
            I hold this result very dearly to me, which is why it‚Äôs my 3rd most important achievement.
